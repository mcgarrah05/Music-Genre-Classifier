# Music Genre Classifier

This project was created by Aubrey McGarrah, using the Million Song Database subset.

## Description
### Overview
My Music Genre Classifier classifies songs into one of the genres I curated *(the list of genres will go here eventually)* based on the following components/parameters:
- danceability and energy
- key signature and time signature
- tempo
- loudness
- and year*

*a possible factor that might help with classification; not sure if I'll end up using it

### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is make a classifier that accurately classifies the genre of a song based on its components, like the key signature and tempo.

The secondary goal of this project is to see if there is any relationship between a song's components and its genre, and if the components have any notable trends or changes throughout the years.

Decide what components of a song (or *fields*, as MSD calls them) that will be looked for the experiment(?) at by using the Million Song Database [Example Track Description](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/example-track-description/). It shows what function will be used to get that component of a song from the song file.  
  
For my project, I am only concerned about the following fields:
- song name and artist name
- artist location
- danceability
- energy
- key and key confidence
- loudness
- tempo
- time signature and time signature confidence
- year

That is how to start this project.
